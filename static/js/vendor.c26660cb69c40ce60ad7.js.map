Each state has a corresponding getter and setter, e.g.\n * `getCenter` and `setCenter` for the `center` state.\n *\n * An `ol.View` has a `projection`. The projection determines the\n * coordinate system of the center, and its units determine the units of the\n * resolution (projection units per pixel). The default projection is\n * Spherical Mercator (EPSG:3857).\n *\n * ### The constraints\n *\n * `setCenter`, `setResolution` and `setRotation` can be used to change the\n * states of the view. Any value can be passed to the setters. And the value\n * that is passed to a setter will effectively be the value set in the view,\n * and returned by the corresponding getter.\n *\n * But an `ol.View` object also has a *resolution constraint*, a\n * *rotation constraint* and a *center constraint*.\n *\n * As said above, no constraints are applied when the setters are used to set\n * new states for the view. Applying constraints is done explicitly through\n * the use of the `constrain*` functions (`constrainResolution` and\n * `constrainRotation` and `constrainCenter`).\n *\n * The main users of the constraints are the interactions and the\n * controls. For example, double-clicking on the map changes the view to\n * the \"next\" resolution. And releasing the fingers after pinch-zooming\n * snaps to the closest resolution (with an animation).\n *\n * The *resolution constraint* snaps to specific resolutions. It is\n * determined by the following options: `resolutions`, `maxResolution`,\n * `maxZoom`, and `zoomFactor`. If `resolutions` is set, the other three\n * options are ignored. See documentation for each option for more\n * information.\n *\n * The *rotation constraint* snaps to specific angles. It is determined\n * by the following options: `enableRotation` and `constrainRotation`.\n * By default the rotation value is snapped to zero when approaching the\n * horizontal.\n *\n * The *center constraint* is determined by the `extent` option. By\n * default the center is not constrained at all.\n *\n * @constructor\n * @extends {ol.Object}\n * @param {olx.ViewOptions=} opt_options View options.\n * @api\n */\nvar _ol_View_ = function(opt_options) {\n  _ol_Object_.call(this);\n  var options = opt_options || {};\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {Array.<number>}\n   */\n  this.hints_ = [0, 0];\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {Array.<Array.<ol.ViewAnimation>>}\n   */\n  this.animations_ = [];\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {number|undefined}\n   */\n  this.updateAnimationKey_;\n\n  this.updateAnimations_ = this.updateAnimations_.bind(this);\n\n  /**\n   * @type {Object.<string, *>}\n   */\n  var properties = {};\n  properties[_ol_ViewProperty_.CENTER] = options.center !== undefined ?\n      options.center : null;\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @const\n   * @type {ol.proj.Projection}\n   */\n  this.projection_ = _ol_proj_.createProjection(options.projection, 'EPSG:3857');\n\n  var resolutionConstraintInfo = _ol_View_.createResolutionConstraint_(\n      options);\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {number}\n   */\n  this.maxResolution_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.maxResolution;\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {number}\n   */\n  this.minResolution_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.minResolution;\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {number}\n   */\n  this.zoomFactor_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.zoomFactor;\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {Array.<number>|undefined}\n   */\n  this.resolutions_ = options.resolutions;\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {number}\n   */\n  this.minZoom_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.minZoom;\n\n  var centerConstraint = _ol_View_.createCenterConstraint_(options);\n  var resolutionConstraint = resolutionConstraintInfo.constraint;\n  var rotationConstraint = _ol_View_.createRotationConstraint_(options);\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {ol.Constraints}\n   */\n  this.constraints_ = new _ol_Constraints_(\n      centerConstraint, resolutionConstraint, rotationConstraint);\n\n  if (options.resolution !== undefined) {\n    properties[_ol_ViewProperty_.RESOLUTION] = options.resolution;\n  } else if (options.zoom !== undefined) {\n    properties[_ol_ViewProperty_.RESOLUTION] = this.constrainResolution(\n        this.maxResolution_, options.zoom - this.minZoom_);\n  }\n  properties[_ol_ViewProperty_.ROTATION] =\n      options.rotation !== undefined ? options.rotation : 0;\n  this.setProperties(properties);\n};\n\n_ol_.inherits(_ol_View_, _ol_Object_);\n\n\n/**\n * Animate the view.

You\n * can customize this behavior by including `duration` (in milliseconds) and\n * `easing` options (see {@link ol.easing}).\n *\n * To chain together multiple animations, call the method with multiple\n * animation objects.  For example, to first zoom and then pan:\n *\n *     view.animate({zoom: 10}, {center: [0, 0]});\n *\n * If you provide a function as the last argument to the animate method, it\n * will get called at the end of an animation series.  The callback will be\n * called with `true` if the animation series completed on its own or `false`\n * if it was cancelled.\n *\n * Animations are cancelled by user interactions (e.g. dragging the map) or by\n * calling `view.setCenter()`, `view.setResolution()`, or `view.setRotation()`\n * (or another method that calls one of these).\n *\n * @param {...(olx.AnimationOptions|function(boolean))} var_args Animation\n *     options.  Multiple animations can be run in series by passing multiple\n *     options objects.  To run multiple animations in parallel, call the method\n *     multiple times.  An optional callback can be provided as a final\n *     argument.  The callback will be called with a boolean indicating whether\n *     the animation completed without being cancelled.\n * @api\n */\n_ol_View_.prototype.animate = function(var_args) {\n  var start = Date.now();\n  var center = this.getCenter().slice();\n  var resolution = this.getResolution();\n  var rotation = this.getRotation();\n  var animationCount = arguments.length;\n  var callback;\n  if (animationCount > 1 && typeof arguments[animationCount - 1] === 'function') {\n    callback = arguments[animationCount - 1];\n    --animationCount;\n  }\n  var series = [];\n  for (var i = 0; i < animationCount; ++i) {\n    var options = /** @type {olx.AnimationOptions} */ (arguments[i]);\n\n    var animation = /** @type {ol.ViewAnimation} */ ({\n      start: start,\n      complete: false,\n      anchor: options.anchor,\n      duration: options.duration !== undefined ?

This is done by subscribing to each Observable in order and,\n * whenever any Observable emits, collecting an array of the most recent\n * values from each Observable. So if you pass `n` Observables to operator,\n * returned Observable will always emit an array of `n` values, in order\n * corresponding to order of passed Observables (value from the first Observable\n * on the first place and so on).\n *\n * Static version of `combineLatest` accepts either an array of Observables\n * or each Observable can be put directly as an argument. Note that array of\n * Observables is good choice, if you don't know beforehand how many Observables\n * you will combine. Passing empty array will result in Observable that\n * completes immediately.\n *\n * To ensure output array has always the same length, `combineLatest` will\n * actually wait for all input Observables to emit at least once,\n * before it starts emitting results. This means if some Observable emits\n * values before other Observables started emitting, all that values but last\n * will be lost. On the other hand, is some Observable does not emit value but\n * completes, resulting Observable will complete at the same moment without\n * emitting anything, since it will be now impossible to include value from\n * completed Observable in resulting array. Also, if some input Observable does\n * not emit any value and never completes, `combineLatest` will also never emit\n * and never complete, since, again, it will wait for all streams to emit some\n * value.\n *\n * If at least one Observable was passed to `combineLatest` and all passed Observables\n * emitted something, resulting Observable will complete when all combined\n * streams complete. So even if some Observable completes, result of\n * `combineLatest` will still emit values when other Observables do. In case\n * of completed Observable, its value from now on will always be the last\n * emitted value. On the other hand, if any Observable errors, `combineLatest`\n * will error immediately as well, and all other Observables will be unsubscribed.\n *\n * `combineLatest` accepts as optional parameter `project` function, which takes\n * as arguments all values that would normally be emitted by resulting Observable.\n * `project` can return any kind of value, which will be then emitted by Observable\n * instead of default array. Note that `project` does not take as argument that array\n * of values, but values themselves. That means default `project` can be imagined\n * as function that takes all its arguments and puts them into an array.\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Combine two timer Observables</caption>\n * const firstTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(0, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting from now\n * const secondTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(500, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting 0,5s from now\n * const combinedTimers = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(firstTimer, secondTimer);\n * combinedTimers.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n * // Logs\n * // [0, 0] after 0.5s\n * // [1, 0] after 1s\n * // [1, 1] after 1.5s\n * // [2, 1] after 2s\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Combine an array of Observables</caption>\n * const observables = [1, 5, 10].map(\n *   n => Rx.Observable.of(n).delay(n * 1000).startWith(0) // emit 0 and then emit n after n seconds\n * );\n * const combined = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(observables);\n * combined.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n * // Logs\n * // [0, 0, 0] immediately\n * // [1, 0, 0] after 1s\n * // [1, 5, 0] after 5s\n * // [1, 5, 10] after 10s\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Use project function to dynamically calculate the Body-Mass Index</caption>\n * var weight = Rx.Observable.of(70, 72, 76, 79, 75);\n * var height = Rx.Observable.of(1.76, 1.77, 1.78);\n * var bmi = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(weight, height, (w, h) => w / (h * h));\n * bmi.subscribe(x => console.log('BMI is ' + x));\n *\n * // With output to console:\n * // BMI is 24.212293388429753\n * // BMI is 23.93948099205209\n * // BMI is 23.671253629592222\n *\n *\n * @see {@link combineAll}\n * @see {@link merge}\n * @see {@link withLatestFrom}\n *\n * @param {ObservableInput} observable1 An input Observable to combine with other Observables.\n * @param {ObservableInput} observable2 An input Observable to combine with other Observables.\n * More than one input Observables may be given as arguments\n * or an array of Observables may be given as the first argument.\n * @param {function} [project] An optional function to project the values from\n * the combined latest values into a new value on the output Observable.\n * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler=null] The IScheduler to use for subscribing to\n * each input Observable.\n * @return {Observable} An Observable of projected values from the most recent\n * values from each input Observable, or an array of the most recent values from\n * each input Observable.\n * @static true\n * @name combineLatest\n * @owner Observable\n */\nfunction combineLatest() {\n    var observables = [];\n    for (var _i = 0; _i < arguments.length; _i++) {\n        observables[_i - 0] = arguments[_i];\n    }\n    var project = null;\n    var scheduler = null;\n    if (isScheduler_1.isScheduler(observables[observables.length - 1])) {\n        scheduler = observables.pop();\n    }\n    if (typeof observables[observables.length - 1] === 'function') {\n        project = observables.pop();\n    }\n    // if the first and only other argument besides the resultSelector is an array\n    // assume it's been called with `combineLatest([obs1, obs2, obs3], project)`\n    if (observables.length === 1 && isArray_1.isArray(observables[0])) {\n        observables = observables[0];\n    }\n    return new ArrayObservable_1.ArrayObservable(observables, scheduler).lift(new combineLatest_1.CombineLatestOperator(project));\n}\nexports.combineLatest = combineLatest;\n//# sourceMappingURL=combineLatest.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/rxjs/observable/combineLatest.js\n// module id = 984\n// module chunks = 0","\"use strict\";\nvar FromEventPatternObservable_1 = require('./FromEventPatternObservable');\nexports.fromEventPattern = FromEventPatternObservable_1.FromEventPatternObservable.create;\n//# sourceMappingURL=fromEventPattern.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/rxjs/observable/fromEventPattern.js\n// module id = 985\n// module chunks = 0","\"use strict\";\nvar merge_1 = require('../operator/merge');\nexports.merge = merge_1.mergeStatic;\n//# sourceMappingURL=merge.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/rxjs/observable/merge.js\n// module id = 986\n// module chunks = 0","\"use strict\";\nvar ArrayObservable_1 = require('./ArrayObservable');\nexports.of = ArrayObservable_1.ArrayObservable.of;\n//# sourceMappingURL=of.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/rxjs/observable/of.js\n// module id = 987\n// module chunks = 0","\"use strict\";\nvar __extends = (this && this.__extends) || function (d, b) {\n    for (var p in b) if (b.hasOwnProperty(p)) d[p] = b[p];\n    function __() { this.constructor = d; }\n    d.prototype = b === null ?
